# Chronologigram

### The way the (Instagram)[http://instagram.com/] timeline should be.

___

Chronologigram (what a name, right?) is a recreation of the Instagram timeline but in chronological order. Why? Because that's how it damn well should be but the Instagram team believes otherwise (or somebody else - probably someone with a lot of money).

In an effort to reign in sanity once had using the app I've decided to, basically, recreate Instagram, using the Instagram API, no less. I don't want to see a post from 10 hours ago at the top of my fead, **expecially** if it's a posts that's only relevant for a few hours (e.g., "Hey guys, I'm live on (Twitch)[http://twitch.tv] right now!"). Come now - does that make sense?

___

The app is very simple. I'm using the React JavaScript library and Sass CSS preprocessor, and running a Node server using the Express framework. I'm also using Babel and Browserify to trans- and compile everything in one file.
